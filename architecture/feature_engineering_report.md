# MCQ Bias Feature Engineering Report
**AI/ML Engineer Implementation - Task 2.1**

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive feature engineering pipeline designed to extract quiz-writing biases from multiple-choice questions. The system focuses on detecting patterns that indicate correct answers based on how questions are constructed, rather than domain knowledge.

## Feature Categories Implemented

### 1. 📏 **Length-Based Features (12 features)**
Exploit the common bias where correct answers tend to be longer or shorter than distractors.

**Key Features:**
- `feat_char_len_mean/std/max/min/range`: Character-based length statistics
- `feat_word_len_mean/std/max/min`: Word-based length statistics  
- `feat_longest_option_bias`: Binary indicator if first option is longest
- `feat_shortest_option_bias`: Binary indicator if first option is shortest
- `feat_opt_{0-3}_char_len/word_len`: Per-option length features

**Bias Detection:** Longest answer bias (common in well-constructed MCQs)

### 2. 🔤 **Keyword-Based Features (24 features)**
Detect bias-indicating phrases and patterns commonly used by question writers.

**Keyword Categories:**
- **All/None patterns**: "all of the above", "none of the above"
- **Qualifier words**: "most", "least", "best", "worst", "always", "never"
- **Uncertainty markers**: "might", "could", "possibly", "probably"
- **Absolute terms**: "definitely", "certainly", "absolutely"
- **Structural elements**: Numbers, punctuation, single words

**Key Features:**
- `feat_opt_{0-3}_{category}`: Per-option keyword presence (20 features)
- `feat_has_{category}`: Global keyword presence (4 features)

**Bias Detection:** "All of the above" often correct, absolute terms often incorrect

### 3. 🔢 **Numeric Bias Features (6 features)**
Analyze mathematical patterns in numeric options.

**Key Features:**
- `feat_all_numeric`: All options are numbers
- `feat_numeric_count`: Proportion of numeric options
- `feat_numeric_middle_bias`: First option is middle value (common bias)
- `feat_numeric_extreme_bias`: First option is min/max
- `feat_numeric_ascending/descending`: Options in sorted order

**Bias Detection:** Middle value bias, avoid extreme values

### 4. 🔗 **Option Overlap Features (8 features)**
Measure text similarity and structural patterns between options.

**Key Features:**
- `feat_overlap_mean/max/min/std`: Jaccard similarity statistics
- `feat_has_common_prefix/suffix`: Structural similarities  
- `feat_common_prefix_length`: Length of shared prefixes

**Bias Detection:** Overlapping options often indicate distractors

### 5. 📊 **Context Features (10 features)**
Capture positional and frequency patterns across questions.

**Key Features:**
- `feat_question_number`: Position in exam
- `feat_question_position_norm`: Normalized position
- `feat_recent_answer_position_mean`: Recent answer patterns
- `feat_option_{a-d}_frequency`: A/B/C/D answer frequency tracking

**Bias Detection:** Position bias, answer distribution patterns

### 6. 🎯 **Rule-Based Composite Scores (6 features)**
Combine multiple indicators into interpretable bias scores.

**Key Features:**
- `feat_longest_option_score`: Composite longest-answer bias
- `feat_first_option_keyword_score`: Keyword-based scoring
- `feat_max_keyword_score`: Best keyword score across options
- `feat_question_complexity`: Question length complexity measure

**Bias Detection:** Multi-factor bias assessment
